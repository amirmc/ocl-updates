Over the next decade or so, lighting systems in buildings all over the world
will shift to using more energy efficient LEDs in place of traditional
tungsten bulbs or fluorescent tubes.  As well as the important reduction in
energy usage, this transition opens up unprecedented opportunities for both
lighting circuit design and embedded systems.

Due to the nature of LEDs, it's feasible to consider deploying ubiquitous
sensor networks alongside the LED lighting in a building.  Since issues of
power and communication are straightforward to tackle, such a network would
allow completely new types of applications and services to be developed. In
addition, there would also be a dramatic impact on the relationship between
people and the building.

The Illuminate project seeks to create a platform to allow others to build
technology and services based on such distributed networks.  Such a platform
would tackle the questions surrounding security, reliability, and
accountability while working with industry to enable new services.
