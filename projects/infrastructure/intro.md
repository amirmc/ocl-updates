OCaml.org is an infrastructure project as part of creating and releasing the
OCaml Platform.  All of the source code is available from the [OCaml
organisation](http://github.com/ocaml) at Github, and anyone can fork
repositories and submit pull requests for consideration by the maintainers.

We are working on setting up the following sub-domains under OCaml.org:

* a public facing site at [ocaml.org](http://ocaml.org), and a staging server for testing updates before they are pushed live.
* a mailing list server with public archives, at [lists.ocaml.org](http://lists.ocaml.org).
* an [opam.ocaml.org](http://opam.ocaml.org) site to host the [OPAM](http://opam.ocamlpro.com) archives and packages. It's useful having a subdomain here to permit future DNS load balancing (`uk.opam.ocaml.org` and so on).
* [git.ocaml.org](http://git.ocaml.org) as a read-only mirror of the Github repositories.
* [oud.ocaml.org](http://oud.ocaml.org) for the HotCRP setup for the OUD conferences.

We are also planning on integrating the OPAM package manager with a [continuous testing system](infrastructure).
An internal Jenkins setup exists at the moment, but will be made suitable for public use.

### Infrastructure

Discussion about the `ocaml.org` infrastructure machines should be directed to the [ocaml.org infrastructure list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure).  This is a public, archived mailing list.

We currently have a single 12-core host `bactrian.ocamllabs.cl.cam.ac.uk`
running Debian and Xen. It is configured with the following VMs:

* `ocaml-mx.ocamllabs.cl.cam.ac.uk` is an internal mailing list relay for list
  traffic.  The `ocaml.org` e-mail is handled via the University [managed domain service](http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/managed-mail-domains), 
  and they relay e-mail for `lists.ocaml.org` over to our VM.  It runs [Mailman](http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/) and [Postfix](http://postfix.org).

* `ocaml-www1.ocamllabs.cl.cam.ac.uk` is a web server VM. It can virtual host multiple non-SSL domains.  It current hosts [realworldocaml.org](http://realworldocaml.org).  Please get in touch with Anil if you need something else hosted here, as it has plenty of capacity at the moment.

* `ocaml-www2.ocamllabs.cl.cam.ac.uk` is another web server VM, currently used to host the [Mirage](mirage.html) website. It switches between being a UNIX VM or a microkernel, depending on the current state of the Mirage tree.
