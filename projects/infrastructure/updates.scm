    The aim of the working group is to formulate a solid transition plan to create a 'basic OCaml ecosystem' that does
    not require camlp4.  Alain Frisch's introductory email has more detail and can be found
     [in the archive](http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-camlp4/2013-January/000000.html).  Working groups are intended
     to be community driven projects and the intent is to archive the list once the projects are complete.
     Two other lists are also planned, which are multicore working group and the ongoing platform list.")
