Building an efficient multi-core garbage collector remains a challenging
research issue. We will begin by investigating techniques that do not
involve fine-grained locking, as this has been shown to be error-prone,
difficult to maintain, and impacts sequential performance. Instead, we
prefer to isolate threads to individual cores, with region-based heaps that
can be garbage collected separately. This technique has been successfully
demonstrated in MultiMLton, system and runtime, and we will implement it in
OCaml and its large body of third-party code.
