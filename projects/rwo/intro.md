Coming soon in 2013 and published by [O'Reilly
Media](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024743.do), is the definitive
practical guide to programming in [OCaml](http://ocaml.org). 

This hands-on book will show you how to take advantage of OCamlâ€™s functional,
imperative, and object-oriented programming styles with recipes for many
real-world tasks.  It covers a range of topics on building and maintaining
fast, reliable code, with a pragmatic emphasis on getting stuff done with
community libraries such as
[Core](https://bitbucket.org/yminsky/ocaml-core/wiki/Home) and Async.

The book starts with OCaml basics, including how to set up a development
environment, and moves toward more advanced topics such as the module system,
foreign-function interface, macro language, and the ocamlbuild system. By the
end of the book, you'll have learned how to solve day-to-day problems in data
processing, numerical computation, system scripting, and database-driven web
applications with the OCaml multi-paradigm programming language.
