  (descr "The Internet of Things is coming, which promises everything from tweeting
    toasters to networked medical devices. However, none of these puts the user at the centre
    of their ‘digital life’. Typically, each new device comes with the requirement to subscribe
    to yet-another cloud service which invariably makes its money by aggregating and selling
    user data.

We’re creating software to allow users to form their own personal cloud of connected devices.
Like having your own internet. This puts the user back at the centre of their network while
allowing the software creators to come up with more innovative products.

In this talk, I’ll briefly describe the Internet of Things as I see it, the issues with the
internet today and also the software we’re creating to enable personal clouds.")
