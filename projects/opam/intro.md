[OPAM](http://opam.ocamlpro.com) is the Ocaml PAckage Manager and its features include: powerful
handling of dependencies (versions constraints, optional dependencies,
conflicts, etc), can deal with multiple repositories' backends (HTTP, rsync,
git) and the ability to switch between different OCaml compiler versions.

The fine grained handling of dependencies is made possible by the use of the
CUDF library and the dose3 solver developed by the
[Mancoosi project](http://www.mancoosi.org), which
is, among other things, used by Debian to manage their packages

In brief, if you use OCaml, [OPAM](http://opam.ocamlpro.com) will probably make your life easier.
