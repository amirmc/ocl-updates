    (descr "Thomas Gazagnaire explained the design rationale behind OPAM,
        and why we need yet another package manager. Audience questions
        were generally positive, but several people expressed concern that
        the build, packaging and test systems were all diverging. OPAM aims
        to unify them eventually, but starts by wrapping existing systems
        for compatibility.")
