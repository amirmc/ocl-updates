Type-based record disambiguation: Leo White has been helping with the
record-disambiguation branch of OCaml by [Jacques Garrigue](http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~garrigue/). This branch uses type-information to
disambiguate between record labels and variant constructors with the same
names. For discussions of the semantics of this feature
see [Gabriel's](http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/gagallium/resolving-field-names/) or [Alain's](http://www.lexifi.com/blog/type-based-selection-label-and-constructors) blog posts.
