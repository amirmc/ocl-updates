Add open extensible types to OCaml. One open type already exists within 
OCaml: the exn type used for exceptions. This project extends this mechanism 
to allow the programmer to create their own open types. This has previously 
been proposed for functional languages a number of times, for instance as 
part of a solution to the expression problem (Loh et al. ["Open Data Types and 
Open Functions"](http://people.cs.uu.nl/andres/OpenDatatypes.pdf)). Unlike 
"exn", these extensible types can have type parameters, allowing for 
extensible GADTs.

For example:

```ocaml
type foo = ..

type foo += A

type foo += B of int

let is_a x =
  match x with
    A -> true
  | _ -> false
```
