  (descr "OS virtualization and cloud computing have radically changed
    the way Internet services are deployed: enterprises share third-party
    datacenters, deploying existing applications with minimal changes.
    Recent measurements reveal a lack of traffic isolation capabilities
    within the datacenter with network performance exhibiting high
    variability. We advocate addressing this problem by allowing
    applications to express their own forwarding logic using OpenFlow
    to achieve application specific optimal performance. We present an
    OpenFlow implementation within the Mirage application synthesis
    framework, in the form of library implementations of a modular
    controller and an extensible OpenFlow-enabled switch, able to
    expose the underlying network infrastructure to cloud applications.
    By linking into the application, this provides a safe yet highly
    extensible framework for programming network control that, although
    unoptimised, still provides reasonable performance when compared with
    existing controllers.")
