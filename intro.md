The goal of OCaml Labs (OCL) is to push the OCaml language, and functional
programming more generally, forward as a real-world platform, making it a more
effective tool for current users (including significant industrial users such
as Jane Street Capital and Citrix Systems), and at the same time growing the
appeal of the language, broadening its applicability and popularity by a
combination of technological advancements, creation of community
infrastructure, and public communications.

OCL is structured as a set of projects hosted within the [University of
Cambridge Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk). Members are based in
the systems, programming languages, theory, digital technology and security
groups, and our express goal is to support cross-group collaboration.

This report is structured in two parts: a set of [monthly
updates](#monthly-progress), and a [project](#projects) collection that
aggregates the longer term activities around particular topics.
